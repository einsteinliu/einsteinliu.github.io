### **Function binding**

std::bind can **create a function which is binded to another one**:

```c++
void originalFunc(std::string a, std::string b, std::string c)
{
    std::cout << a << " " << b << " " << c << std::endl;
}//original function, to be binded

void main()
{
  	//Newly binded function, created by bind function
  	auto newlyBindedFunc = bind(originalFunc, placeholders::_3, "Fixed", placeholders::_1);
    //Call the newly binded function
    newlyBindedFunc("New 1st",    "New 2nd",   "New 3rd");
}
```

<!-- more -->

We can see that calling 

***newlyBindedFunc("New 1st",    "New 2nd",   "New 3rd");***

is exactly the same as calling

***originalFunc("New 3rd", "Fixed", "New 1st");***

So the bind function is just **remapping the input arguments**:

![function_bind]({{ site.url }}\images\cpp\function_bind.png)

Just as the above diagram shows, using the bind in this case,

the 3rd(std::placeholders::_3)  argument of newlyBindedFunc is mapped to the 1st input argument of originalFunc: **string a**.

the 1st(std::placeholders::1) argument of newlyBindedFunc is mapped to the 3rd input argument of originalFunc: **string c**.

the 2nd argument of originalFunc is already **defined** by std::bind as "fixed".

### **Move things into Closure**

Sometimes copy a object into a closure is very expensive(STL containers), **we prefer moving them instead of copying them**, but C++ 11 doesn't support it.

Fortunately, we can use bind as a workaround:

```c++
	vector<int> originalData{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 };

	auto func = bind(
      [](vector<int>& data)
	  {
		  for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++)
		  {
			 cout << data[i] << " ";
		  }
	  },
	  move(originalData)
	);

	func();
```

The code is straightforward, we use std::bind to create a new function ***func***, which is binded to a lambda. The lambda has one input and it's defined by std::bind to be ***move(originalData)***.

So actually the input argument ***originalData*** is passed by bind function, when you are really calling ***func()***, **you don't need to pass anything.**
