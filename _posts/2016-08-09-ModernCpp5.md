You should include <memory> when using smart pointers

### unique_ptr

Just as its name means, unique_ptr guarantees that **there is only one pointer point to a specific memory block**. So it cannot be copied by only moved.

**Init a unique_ptr**

```c++
unique_ptr<int> p{ new int };
unique_ptr<int> p{ new int{4} };
```

As you can see, smart pointers are wraps of normal pointers, we call them "raw" pointers.

**move a unique_ptr**

```c++
unique_ptr<int> q = p; //wrong, copy is not allowed
unique_ptr<int> q = move(p);//move p to q
if (p == nullptr)
		cout << "p is null now\n";
```

unique_ptr can only be moved, when the original unique_ptr is moved to another one, the original unique_ptr will be equal to nullptr.

**delete a unique_ptr**

```c++
p.release();
```

delete is not supported, you should use its "release" method.

**use unique_ptr for factory pattern**

```c++
unique_ptr<int> createnew(){
	return unique_ptr<int>{new int{4}};
}//produce a unique_ptr
```

**when you return a unique_ptr in a function, it is actually use its move method implicitly.** So the unique_ptr is cleanly produced that you get the original, unique pointer.

**What's more, an unique_ptr can be moved to a shared_ptr!** 

```c++
	unique_ptr<int> q{ new int{4} };
	shared_ptr<int> s = move(q);
```

That means you can do the following:

```c++
shared_ptr<int> createnewShared(){
	return unique_ptr<int>{new int{ 4 }};
}//produce a shared_ptr
```

if you want to produce a shared_ptr, the original version as an unique_ptr is moved, which means the newly produced shared_ptr will be the only existed copy of the original version, this is very clean.

If you want to use unique_ptr for array, you should declare it as:

```c++
	int n = 5;
	unique_ptr<int[]> intArray{ new int[n] };
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		intArray[i] = i;
```
