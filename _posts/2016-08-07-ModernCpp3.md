### <center>Alias is preferred to typedef</center>

It is clearer:

```c++
typedef void (*FP)(int, const std::string&); // old way: typedef
using FP = void (*)(int, const std::string&); // new way: alias
```

It support template:

```c++
template<typename T>
using MyAllocList = std::list<T, MyAlloc<T>>;
```

### <center>enum is preferred to be scoped</center>

Comparison between the old and new way:

<!-- more -->

```c++
enum Color { black, white, red };
enum class Color { black, white, red };
```

Using the old way, the enums are all globally active,then:

```c++
auto white = false
```

will be wrong, because the word ***white*** is already defined. When using the new method, ***Color::white*** will be used instead, so ***white*** is now free to use.

We can also call it "enum class".

**Attention: scoped enum can not be converted to int implicitly!** *Color::white* is not equal to 1, it is just *Color::white*. But you can define a enum's underlying type:

```c++
enum Color: short {black=0,white=1,red=2};
```

**Forward declaration is supported:**

```c++
enum class Color;
```

### <center>override should be added when overriding</center>

```c++
class  Base
{
public:
	Base() {};
	 ~Base() {};
	 virtual void func() 
     { 
       	cout << "I am base class\n"; 
     };
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	Derived() {};
	~Derived() {};
	void func() override 
    { 
      	Base::func(); 
      	cout << "I am derived class\n"; 
    };
};
void main()
{
	Derived derived;
	derived.func();
}
/*The output will be:
I am base class
I am derived class
*/
```
