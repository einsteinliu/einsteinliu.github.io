In graph optimization 1 to 3, the math is introduced. Now we can make some hands on practice on programming. The most famous used graph optimization library is g2o due to its good performance in ORB-SLAM. g2o also has its well known drawback - not well commented, not easy to understand. What's more, most of the tutorials are based on the original sample examples, when you want to make your own vertex or edge, you will again be lost.


This introduction will be based on an easy to understand graph optimization problem with a customized edge implementation.

### Modelling the GPS based odometry

#### Model as graph

The problem is quite easy: we have a vehicle moving around, we use a GPS to **measure** its 3D absolute positions, by making some rough guesses as **initialization**,  we want to **estimate** the vehicle's position based on the GPS' measurements. 

In a SLAM system, we usually want to fuse different sensors, what's discussed most are fusing camera and IMU, which is also the problem setup for g2o examples. Fusing GPS information is rarely touched, actually GPS sensor fusion is easier to understand. It can be modeled as the following diagram:

The light blue vertexes are camera poses to be estimated, it's represented as 6 Dof pose just for the convenience of future work, considering only GPS measurements, only 3 Dof will be optimized. 

The dark blue vertexes are GPS measurements, they are fixed. The dark blue arrows are the **edges representing the error between the measurement and estimation**, which in our case is simply the difference between the measurement and the estimation. 

The dark blue vertexes are **"pulling"** the light blue vertexes toward them, just as what's happening in the real world : we try to estimate something that fit the measurements best.

#### Model as equation

The optimization problem can be expressed as the following equation:

$$
X^*_{1..i}=\arg \max_{X_{1..i}}\sum_i(e_{i}^T\Omega_i e_i)
$$

$$X_i$$ is the estimation, which is being updated in the optimization loop; $$Z_i$$ is the measurement for $$X_i$$ , which is fixed; the error $$e_i$$ is the error we get between estimation and measurement. 

$$\Omega$$ is the so called "information" matrix, in our case, as the poses are not correlated to each other, it is a identical matrix, if we consider $$\Omega_i$$ is its $$i$$th diagonal element, $$\Omega_i$$ will always be one.

Put the error in, we get the complete equation:

$$
X^*_{1..i}=\arg \max_{X_{1..i}}\sum_i((X_i-Z_i)^T\Omega_i (X_i-Z_i))
$$

For the graph optimization problem, we also need the Jacobian matrix, which contains:

$$
\frac{d e_i}{d X_i}=\frac{d(X_i-Z_i)}{d X_i}=1
$$

Obviously, our Jacobian matrix is also a diagonal matrix!

Now, we get everything ready for the math.
